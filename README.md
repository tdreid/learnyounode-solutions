# learnyounode-solutions
My solutions to learn you the Node.js for much win!

These are provided both for critique/feedback or 
for other learners who might like to peek at what 
someone else did.

I don't claim that these are by any means optimal 
solutions. They just happen to be the way I muddled 
through on my first try. All of these solutions do 
pass ```learnyounode verify``` except maybe my 
solution to number #13 (HTTP JSON API SERVER.)

In that case I was workingin an environment where 
the ports in the default verify tests cases weren't 
guranteed available. But I messed around with my
solution quite a bit and I'm satisfied that it would 
pass otherwise. If you confirm a problem with it 
or anything else please let me know.
